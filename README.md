#   Moonrise:  A schematic agent to brighten your night

Use Moonrise to start a new “empty” Urbit app project using the nested core pattern.  Import the repo, then simply rename all text and files from `moonrise` to whatever your new agent's name will be.

Moonrise is modestly opinionated but generally straightforward.  If you are interested in omitting the `++abet` nested-core pattern from your agent, see [Sunrise](https://github.com/sigilante/sunrise).
